You were a man of spirit, writing and knowledge in various fields, you wrote us texts full of wit and humor which we used to celebrate the holidays. In the professional field, you were a significant and influential figure in the kibbutz's accounting, a fine professional. We were privileged in Nir Oz to enjoy all the talents it blesses. You suffered the loss of both of your parents, the sudden death of your father Yoram from which you had a hard time recovering, and the long and painful separation from your mother Pnina. A picture of both your parents was placed by you in a prominent place in your office and they accompanied you with their gaze every day. The family you left behind, your children whom you loved with all your heart, Asif, Bar, Dekel and Gal, and your sister Samdar and her family, mourn and pain your murder in such a cruel way and are in tense and tormented anticipation of the return home of your wife Mia. Our Avner, all of us in Nir Oz will miss you very, very much. May your memory be blessed.",

When she heard the alarms, she hurried back home, but the terrorists entered the garden and she had to hide under the children's bed. After informing her son of what was happening, contact with her was lost and only a few days later her phone was found in Gaza and the message arrived - Mia was kidnapped. Avner, her husband, was in the Mmad Beitam and was murdered, now the members of the kibbutz have announced that Mia was murdered. Mia and Avner raised a loving, strong and close-knit family, educating their four children on the values of contribution and giving, love and faith in a person. Her children say that Mia already longs to be a grandmother, she She must have been an amazing grandmother. Mia's four children and the hundreds of other children she raised and educated in the kibbutz and together with the entire people of Israel are pained by the bitter news. May their memory be blessed",

His figure is still before our eyes, pacing back and forth, restless, on the dining room floor. A cigarette in the corner of his mouth and he is ready to drive, help, provide service to someone. Everything is aimed at one goal to provide a personal, sensitive and caring service to each and every person, through the love of his life. Who would have thought that he would meet his death in such a criminal way. Our Yosinio, we miss you and your traveling home very much already. May your memory be blessed.",

I remember the early days of the furniture restoration gallery, each item had a price listed and Yuna always apologized when she said the price out loud. She didn't yet realize how low the price was compared to the beautiful item she renovated. I have some of her furniture at home, and later she turned the small carpentry into a boutique furniture empire. A few years ago I came to her at the South Red Fair with a showcase full of desserts. And we haven't seen each other since. I don't often come to the Bari area, and precisely in the last few months, the opportunity to come and sell at the kibbutz slowly arose again, I was so happy that we would see each other again and meet familiar faces again.

      "A Indian woman was kidnapped to Gaza in the attack on Bari, and her husband was murdered. Judith was diagnosed with Graten before she was kidnapped, so there was great concern for her safety until it was known about her murder. Friends tell about her, from Yehudit I remember the wide smile that first started from her eyes, then went down to her lips. Those who knew her surely remember her quiet and warm voice, and endless optimism that accompanied her and made sure to spread it everywhere. Judith loved man and nature, and as such, traveled endlessly, inviting everyone to join in the beauty she saw in nature. Judith, unfathomable, there was still hope in us when you were declared a kidnapper, and now you join your beloved Shmulik, whose life was taken by the murderers already on that accursed Sabbath. You will always be remembered like this for us, with that infectious smile.",

This choice accompanied him throughout his life, which was interrupted at one point by the murderers of Bnei Baliel. Roi, known by the nickname Monder among Netanya and Liverpool fans, was a center of knowledge and Urim and Tomim quite a few topics of conversation among the fans, which made him well-known and significant and above all lovable. Monder, we never thought how relevant that sweeping fan song would be. Roy was murdered, his parents, his sister and his nephew Ohad Ben-Hasteen were kidnapped to Gaza, in the illusory, sad, difficult reality we live in there is no one who sat on Roy Shiva. The extended family will sit, but there is no person who is required according to Judaism to sit Shabbat because they are kidnapped. Those closest to Roy did not attend the funeral because they were kidnapped. In what world is a person corrected who has a family that cannot pay their last respects because they are kidnapped.",

You taught almost all the toddlers in Nir Oz to sit on the potty in the common education. Over the years you moved to work in the commune, you got to know each and every piece of clothing and you knew who it belonged to. More than once she scolded us for not coming to pick up the laundry on time. And when we failed to decipher the number of the garment, you would find it in your own special way. Wherever you worked, you did it with the thoroughness and diligence of an ant, and you invested in them care and energy in your unique way. A special and great place in your heart was reserved for your daughters and grandchildren, whose visits to Nir-Oz were a source of both comfort and pride for you. May your memory be blessed dear Shepra, we love you very much, your friends at Kibbutz Nir Oz.",

      "Ronit Tal Sultan immigrated to Israel from Argentina and together with her partner Roland established their home in Kibbutz Holit. She spoke Spanish and he French and they raised their children in Hebrew only. When the children grew up, Ronit decided to enroll in undergraduate studies, she studied in the Department of Creative Culture and Production at Sapir College, and even though she was older than most of her classmates, she fit in perfectly and found a common language with many, many who became true friends even after the school period. To the lecturers she is remembered as a student full of curiosity and passion for knowledge, always bright and smiling, hardworking and intelligent and of course graduated with honors. From there she went on to study for a master's degree in art history at Ben Gurion University, and immediately after for a doctorate that dealt with protest art in Argentina during the military dictatorship. She dreamed of returning to teach where she began her studies. Thanks to her cordial and positive personality, she soon integrated herself as a practitioner in various courses at Ben Gurion University and Sapir College. A few weeks before her death, she received the opinions of the doctoral judges, which were positive and flattering, and required only minor corrections. Ahead of the new school year, she had already begun to prepare a new course, but a brutal attack on her kibbutz on Saturday morning took her life while she was by her sick husband's side.",

The woodwork probably did not survive the fire, but his ironwork is scattered throughout Bari, and on the outskirts of the kibbutz stand the ostrich farm and the horse stables that he built with wise hands, slowly but precisely. The spiritual legacy he left behind, no fire can consume. Even now, above his grave, it is clear and stable as a rock, love for family, giving without return and without conditions, and the simple imperative to be human. We miss you very much, we will all miss you, your presence did wonders at home, you brought happiness and joy wherever you were. Rest in peace",

After the attack, a triad officer and a social worker arrived at the family's house, who informed the family that Dror's phone was inside the Gaza Strip. That's the only thing they knew how to say, she said at the time. He was considered abducted because of the indication that his phone was in Gaza and because they saw that it was taken, but we don't know Nothing for sure.  Dror Kaplon was waiting for the moment when he could retire, it was written in a statement from the headquarters of the families of the abductees. A year ago it happened and since then he has been flying about his life, as his son describes. He volunteered at Kibbutz Bari's library, listened to podcasts, cooked healthy food and most of all spent time with his five grandchildren. He was a total grandfather when he was with his grandchildren, he was with them one hundred percent and they loved him back and many sat next to him in the dining room.",

Her lovers say that she was a wonderful storyteller, and that during her lifetime she read countless books to countless children who grew up and became parents and grandparents themselves. She also had a lovely collection of bookmarks for books from all over the world, a testament to her great love of books. When she retired, she devoted herself to an occupation that was delightful to her, establishing the children's library of the kibbutz. Her grandson, Omer Keren, wrote in her memory that Grandma Hana was the most optimistic person in the world. She went through difficult things in life, and still, even in the most difficult moments, when they asked her how she was, she would answer 'tomorrow will be better'. When her angelic Filipino caregiver, who heroically protected her for twenty hours in the small dimension, came to say goodbye to her at the hospital, she burst into tears, 'Who will tell me to wake up tomorrow morning with a new song in my heart.",

He bends and turns on his axis, in his hands a thick and long rope that draws a huge circle of movement. Around him stand in a circle his three sons from his family, sometimes cousins from the Peleg family also join. David and the rope rotate and the cousins jump one by one as the rope passes under them. Be careful not to hit the rope or get disqualified and leave the game. David is the son of a mother who and her sisters survived the holocaust, lost their entire family and came to this country thinking that never again. In recent years, David devotedly cared for Aunt Ester, the third sister who survived the Holocaust and was a childless widow. The brutal death of him and Tal and all the other murdered and victims of the horrible massacre is heartbreaking.",
